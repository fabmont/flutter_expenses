# Flutter Expenses
This is a study case app of a simple personal expenses manager.

## Stack
- This project was made with Flutter (Dart programming language) and I have implemented local state manager with Stateful Widgets.
- For the UI language, it uses the Google's Material Design.

## Overview
I started building this project to learn the core concepts and the basics of Dart and Flutter framework.
I learned how widgets work and how Flutter deal with state changes; how to build custom widgets and how to use state inside Stateful widgets; and how to pass properties between widgets inside the Flutter's widgets tree.

I'm very confident about Flutter and as a React Native developer, I'm having no big troubles with Dart and Flutter until now.
